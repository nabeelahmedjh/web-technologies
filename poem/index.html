            <p>
                <pre>
                    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    And sorry I could not travel both
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    And be one traveler, long I stood
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    And looked down one as far as I could
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    Then took the other, as just as fair,
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    And having perhaps the better claim,
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Though as for that the passing there
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Had worn them really about the same,
                </pre>

            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    And both that morning equally lay
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    In leaves no step had trodden black.
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    I doubted if I should ever come back.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    I shall be telling this with a sigh
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Somewhere ages and ages hence:

                    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    I took the one less traveled by,
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    And that has made all the difference.
